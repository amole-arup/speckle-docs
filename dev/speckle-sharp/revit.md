# Revit

The Speckle 2.0 Revit Connector is currently in ‚ö†ALPHA‚ö† and is a bit rough around the edges -- please use at your own risk! And of course, we'd really appreciate any feedback, comments, suggestions, etc ‚ú®

## Getting Started üèÅ

### Requirements

- Revit 2019, 2020, or 2021
- A Speckle Server running (more on this below)
- Speckle Manager (more on this below)

## Local Setup 

### Server

In order to test Speckle in all its glory, you'll need a server running. You can run a local one by simply following the instructions in the [Server Repo](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server)

If you're facing any errors, make sure Postgres and Redis are up and running.

### Accounts

The connector itself doesn't have features to manage your Speckle accounts. This functionality has been delegated to the Speckle Manager desktop app.

You can install an alpha version of it from: [here](https://speckle-releases.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/manager/SpeckleManager%20Setup.exe)

After installing it, you can use it to add/create an account on the Server.

## Debugging

In your IDE, you can select which Revit version you want to run. If you're having SQLite issues when building, make doubly sure that you're on x64.

The button to launch the connector should now appear in the Add-Ins ribbon. You're ready to go!
