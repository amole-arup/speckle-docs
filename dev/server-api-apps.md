# Introduction

Speckle server, frontend and viewer are hosted in our [speckle-server](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server) repo, each project has its own folder and readme with instructions on how to build it.

## Server API

The best way to explore and understand the Server API is to use our interactive explorer. Simply head to `YOUR-SERVER-ADDRESS/explorer`, and on the right panel you'll be able to see the API docs and schemas.
After logging in you'll also be able to execute queries and mutations as the logged in user.

Alternatively, the classic GraphQL explorer is also available at `YOUR-SERVER-ADDRESS/graphql`.
