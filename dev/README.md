# Getting Started
Welcome to the developer docs! We hope to see the great things you'll do with our SDKs and APIs.

Please make sure to read out [contribution guidelines](contributing) if you're planning on submitting feature requests or fixing bugs.

## What is Speckle?
Speckle is the Open Source Data Platform for AEC. Speckle allows you to say goodbye to files: we give you object-level control of what you share, infinite versioning history & changelogs. Read more on [our website](https://speckle.systems).

## GitHub repos
The code for anything Speckle 2.0 onwards is hosted in our [GitHub specklesystems organization](https://github.com/specklesystems).
Please make sure to give our repos a star ⭐️ if you like what you see!
