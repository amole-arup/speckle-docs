# Using our embeddable 3D viewer

This section is currently being built ðŸš§, please check again later.

::: tip 

For the brave, there's an example application in the [viewer package right here](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/viewer).

:::

Our end goals are:
- easy to load and unload speckle data
- easy to embed in your own react/vue/vanilla web apps
- easy to customise with your own tree views, etc.
