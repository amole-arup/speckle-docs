# About Core

Core is the .NET SDK for Speckle 2.0. It uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS.

## Building

Make sure you clone this repository together with its submodules: `git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/Core.git -recursive`.
Afterwards, just restore all the NuGet packages and hit Build!

## Developing

This project is evolving fast, to better understand how to use Core we suggest checking out the Unit and Integration tests. Running the integration tests locally requires a local server running on your computer.

We'll be also adding [preliminary documentation on our forum](https://discourse.speckle.works/c/speckle-insider/10).

## Tests

There are two test projects, one for unit tests and one for integration tests. The latter needs a server running locally in order to run.
