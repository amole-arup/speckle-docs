# Core

Core is the .NET SDK for Speckle 2.0. It uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS.

## Developing

This project is evolving fast, to better understand how to use Core we suggest checking out the Unit and Integration tests. Running the integration tests locally requires a local server running on your computer. To learn how to ge a local server up, head over to the [Speckle Web Docs](/dev/web)

## Tests

There are two test projects: one for unit tests and one for integration tests. The latter needs a server running locally in order to run.
