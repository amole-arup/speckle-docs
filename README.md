## Introduction

This is the home of [Speckle.Guide](https://speckle.guide/) - the home of our user guides and dev docs. The guide is split into three sections:

- `/user`: practical guides for end users
- `/dev`: developer documentation
-

## Developing & Debugging

This repo is a vuepress site. To get up and running, just run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

## Contributing

If you would like to expand on any of the sections, please feel free! We are also particularly interested in use cases and examples. If you have a cool workflow or use case that you think would be helpful to the community, we'd be happy to have it in the guide!

Please make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview of the best practices we try to follow.
