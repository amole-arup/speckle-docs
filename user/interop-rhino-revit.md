# Rhino âž¡ Revit

Speckle 2.0 gives you the option of streaming objects as base geometry from Rhino to Revit, or directly into Revit families as BuiltElements through the Rhino schema builder commands. 

![Direct Conversion Example]()

## Features

Currently, direct conversions are available for the following types:

| Base Geometry | BuiltElement schemas | Revit type |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Planar surface | `Wall` `Floor` `Ceiling` `Roof` | |
| Planar polysurface | `Wall` | |
| Planar and nurbs surface | `FaceWall` | x |
| Line | `Column` `Beam` | |
| Brep / extrusion | `DirectShape` | x |
| Mesh | `DirectShape` | x |

## Walkthrough

Stream your Rhino objects directly into Revit as BuiltElements! Rhino to Revit interop uses a custom Speckle Attribute User Text (AUT) string to determine an object's schema before sending streams. AUTs are modified with two commands:
 - `ApplySpeckleSchema` gives you options for adding AUTs to model objects
 - `RemoveSpeckleSchema` removes schema AUTs from model objects
Some schemas have additional parameters that can be manually modified for custom control over parameters like Revit Family or Revit Type.

## Assigning schemas

![ApplySpeckleSchema Example]()

### The automagic method 

The easiest way to assign schemas to your Rhino objects is to let the Speckle schema builder decide for you!

 1. Type `ApplySpeckleSchema` in the command line
 2. Select objects for BuiltElements conversion
 3. By default, `Automatic` is set to `On`. Press **Enter**!
 
 The algorithm for automatic schema application takes into account object and layer naming before it tries to find the best BuiltElements schema to apply. For example, if an object has *Wall* in its name, or in the absence of a name, the object is nested in a layer with a name that includes *Wall*, then the automatic method will try to send the object as a Speckle `Wall` element. If the algorithm can't find a BuiltElements type in either the object or layer name, it will analyze the object geometry and try to find the first schema fit based on the object's properties.
 
 **note** `DirectShape` conversions are not assigned during the automagic method. If an XY planar surface does not have a specific schema in its object or layer name, it will default to `Floor`, instead of `Roof` or `Ceiling`.
 
### The single schema method

You can assign a specific schema to selected objects through the single schema method: this method also includes conversions to `DirectShape` and `FaceWall` schemas.

1. Type `ApplySpeckleSchema` in the command line
2. Set `Automatic` to `Off`
3. Select a `Schema` option
4. By default, `DirectShape` is set to `Off`. To send as a DirectShape instead of a native object, set the toggle to `On`. 
5. Select objects for schema application, and press **Enter**!

### Customizing properties

Revit-specific BuiltElements schemas such as `FaceWall` and `DirectShape` can be manually customized with additional properties. By default, these schemas will have a user string with the following formats:

```
FaceWall([family], [type])
DirectShape(Schema, UniqueName)
```
To assign custom values, select your FaceWall or DirectShape object and navigate to its User Attribute Text panel. Double click on the *SpeckleSchema* entry value and replace the `[]` properties with custom values if you want to assign a specific Revit family or type to your `FaceWall` object. If no changes are made, FaceWalls are assigned to the `Basic Wall` type by default. For DirectShapes, a unique shape name is automatically generated, but can be changed to a custom string if desired.

## Removing schemas

Removing schemas from Rhino objects is super easy:

1. Type `RemoveSpeckleSchema` in the command line
2. Select objects to remove schemas from
3. Press **Enter** - Speckle AUT strings are now deleted from all selected objects!
