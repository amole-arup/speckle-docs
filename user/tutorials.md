# Introduction

We have resources for all levels to help you get started and get the most out of Speckle!

## Getting Started

Coming soon!

## Interoperability

#### Rhino âž¡ Revit

**Level:** beginner
**Author:** Claire
**Software used:** Revit 2021, Rhino 7

Learn how to stream _Rhino_ geometry directly into _Revit_ as native elements with Speckle!

#### Grasshopper âž¡ Revit

**Level:** intermediate
**Author:** Alan
**Software used:** Revit 2021, Grasshopper for Rhino 7

You can stream _Grasshopper_ native geometry to _Revit_ using Speckle! In this guide, we will send different types of geometry and built elements to Revit to understand how Speckle converts them into native Revit elements.

#### Revit âž¡ Grasshopper âž¡ Revit

**Level:** advanced
**Author:** Alan
**Software used:** Revit 2021, Grasshopper for Rhino 7

You can stream _Revit_ native elements to _Grasshopper_ using Speckle! In this guide, we will send different types of Revit elements, update their parameters in Grasshopper and send them back to Revit.

#### Quality control AutoCAD drawings in Grasshopper

**Level:** intermediate
**Author:** Claire
**Software used:** AutoCAD, Rhino, Grasshopper

Quality control your _AutoCAD_ drawing with the visual programming power of _Grasshopper_! In this tutorial, we'll send a floorplan from AutoCAD to Rhino with Speckle, run a simple Grasshopper script to find incorrectly drawn lines, and send the annotations back to AutoCAD. We'll also adjust some blocks in Rhino along the way.

## Unity

#### Create interactive real time experiences with Unity, Revit and Rhino

**Level:** advanced
**Author:** Matteo
**Software used:** Unity, Revit 2021, Rhino 7

In this tutorial we will create an interactive _Unity_ app that renders _Revit_ data in real time. We'll see how the Unity connector works and how to write custom code that pulls data from Speckle that was generated in Revit and Rhino. We'll also see how to work with streams and branches to organize data.
