# Core Concepts

This section goes into the details on how your data is sent to and stored in Speckle. If you're new to Speckle or need a refresher on the concepts we've introduced in v2, this is a great place to start!

::: tip
Whenever we mention the word **data**, or **objects** or **elements** etc, we're always referring to the same thing. This could be CAD geometry, BIM elements (geometry+data) or pure data (text, numbers, etc...).

### Streams, Branches and Commits

Your Speckle data is organised using a robust and sophisticated collaboration approach that's been adopted universally in software development. To keep things simple, we're using the same concepts and terminology, known as **Streams**, **Branches** and **Commits**.

To use Speckle you only really need to know what a stream is. Branches and commits are slightly more advanced, but will add a lot of flexibility and control to your future collaborative workflows.

## Streams

### What are streams

The main data structure in Speckle is the **stream**.

A stream is simply a collection of data with some additional information to help you manage and retrieve them. Each stream is assigned a `streamId` which uniquely identifies the stream on a server. You can also assign a name and description to help keep track of your streams.

A stream also lets you manage permissions: it has a list of collaborators including an owner and additional reviewers and contributors which the owner has chosen to share the stream with.

### What do streams contain?

A stream can contain anything from a handful of objects to a whole building model. You are free to add as much or as little data to a single stream and create as many streams as you'd like. Some examples of what might be contained within a stream are:

- A layer in a CAD application
- A set of calculation results
- A workset in Revit
- A selection of objects from Grasshopper
- A structural model

A stream also contains further options for managing your data using  **branches** and **commits**. Don't worry about these yet - we'll cover them in the following sections.

### Who can I share streams with?

Streams can be either Public or Private:;

- **Public**: Anyone with the link or `streamId` can view the stream
- **Private**: People need to be added as _collaborators_ to the stream to access it

Anyone invited as a collaborator can have varying levels of access to the stream, depending on which role you assign them:

- **Owner**: Full access, including deletion rights and editing user permissions.
- **Contributor**: Can edit the stream's contents (create new branches and commits) but cannot edit stream details (name and description) or manage permissions.
- **Reviewer**: View-only access to a stream.

### How do I use streams?

Streams are the main mechanism by which data is shared between people and applications. For example, you could create a stream in Revit and send that data to your server. Then, any of your colleagues with access to that stream could view the data in the browser or receive the data in Grasshopper, Rhino, Revit, etc.

If any of your colleagues have _collaborator_ access, they are also free to make their own changes and send their changes to the stream. You can then receive those changes from the stream in your original model to see the changes reflected.

## Branches

### What are branches?

Branches give you an extra layer of organisation within a stream. Speckle users frequently use branches to carry out parallel studies / design options.

All streams start with a single default branch called `main`. If you would like to "branch" off from this `main` branch and work on multiple different versions of your data in parallel or if you want to segment separate parts of your data from each other, that is where branches come in.

### How do I use branches?

You can add as many additional branches to your streams as you would like. Some Connectors and the Speckle Web App give you the option of creating new branches and switching between them.

Let's say you have a very large model you want to add to a single stream, but your collaborators from different disciplines don't want to receive the whole model every time. You could split the model up into different branches: `Structural`, `MEP`, `Architecture`.

Or perhaps you have a complex model that encompasses a site with multiple separate buildings. You could still contain the whole model in a single stream, but create a separate branch for each building: `Building A`, `Building B`, `Building C`.

Maybe you're working on a smaller scale and you would like to present a different facade options to the client. The stream could be split into `Option A`, `Option B`, and `Option C` which you could then easily switch between to explore the different options in your next meeting.

If you happen to be familiar with `git`, you might be wondering _"Can I also merge the content of a branch into another one?"_. The answer is yes, but currently that can only happen inside one of the AEC software for which we have connectors. The merged data can then be re-sent to an existing or new branch.

## Commits

### What are commits?

Commits are essentially a snapshot of your data - a point in time where you have "committed" your changes. They allow you to track the changes in your stream and easily see who changed what and when. The great thing about commits is that they create a timeline of all the changes your stream goes through and give you the possibility of going back in time, resetting your model to any version - whenever you want!

Each time you send data to Speckle, you are automatically creating a new commit which contains all the objects in your stream along with additional information such as the time, date, and author of the commit. You can also add an optional _commit message_ which is a short description of what you've changed. Like a stream, each commit is assigned a generated `commitId` which can be used to identify and retrieve it. You can go back in time and look at the history of your stream through the series of commits.

Say goodbye to saving your files as "AM_Project_Design-final", "AM_Project_Design-final-final", "AM_Project_Design-final-final-latest"...!

::: tip IMPORTANT ðŸ™Œ
Please Note: Commits aren't editable, you can change their message but not their content. Sent the wrong data? No problem - simply send the correct data and work from that commit instead.

### How do I use commits?

If you have used a connector and you've sent data to a stream, you've already used them! Each time data is sent to a stream, a commit is created. To help you keep track of the changes in your stream, it is a good idea to add a commit message that succinctly describes what the commit contains. Some of the connectors pre-populate a default commit message for you, but you are still free to write your own to add more detail.

When receiving data in a connector, you have the option of either staying synced with the latest commit or receiving a specific commit based on the `commitId`. If you choose to stay on the latest commit, you'll see a notification when someone else has sent new data to the stream. When you see this, you'll be able to use the receive function to get the new commit and update your file.

## How's Your Brain Holding Up?

For some users, this is their first time hearing about streams, branches and commits. Your head must be spinning!

However, some users can't get enough of this and are ready to take a deep dive into some of our more advanced topics. For these users, we've got you covered!

## The Base Object

The `Base` object is probably not something you'll have to deal with directly when you're just getting started with Speckle. However, it is a helpful concept to be aware of if you want to get into creating custom Speckle objects, working on your own conversions, or building scripts or apps on top of Speckle.

### What is it?

Sending a collection of Revit elements? Each of those elements is being converted into a Speckle Object equivalent which inherits from the `Base` class. The commit you just created when sending those elements? That is also a `Base` which contains all the Revit elements nested within it.

The `Base` object is the building block of Speckle data. It is a dynamic object that is the "base" of all other Speckle objects. The `Base` and other objects that inherit from it have a combination of pre-defined properties (eg `id`, `speckle_type`, `units`) and dynamic properties which can be added on the fly. Property values can also be other `Base` objects such as a `RevitColumn` containing a `Line` representing its base line.

An key feature of the `Base` object is _decomposition_. This allows you to flag properties as _detachable_ so they exist outside of the parent `Base` object and can be stored and retrieved separately. As a simplistic example, say you have several `Beam` and `Wall` elements that all want to reference the same `Level`. Instead of creating multiple copies of this `Level` and storing it within each of the `Beam` and `Wall` objects, you would instead make the `Level` detachable in the `Beam`s and `Wall`s. This allows all the objects to reference the same `Level` which is stored once individually.

### How do I use it?

When using the connectors to send existing data, you won't really need to think about the `Base` object as all this is taken care of for you behind the scenes. The objects in your model are converted to Speckle `Base` objects and then are nested within a parent `Base` object to create the commit - all when you press the "Send" button.

If you are getting into creating your own `Base` objects, our [The Base Object](/dev/base) section and the [Decomposition API](/dev/decomposition) are a great way to get started.
