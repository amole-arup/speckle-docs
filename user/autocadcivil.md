# AutoCAD & Civil 3D

Speckle currently supports Autodesk AutoCAD 2021 and Civil 3D 2021.

‚ö† _This connector is currently in alpha with limited functionality._

## Getting Started

To install this connector and add your Speckle account, follow the instructions in [Speckle Manager](/user/manager).
Once installed, you can find this connector in the `Add-ins` tab under `Speckle 2`. Click the plugin button to call the Speckle Desktop UI for sending and receiving streams.

## User Interface

::: tip IMPORTANT üôå

This connector uses our shared Desktop UI. Read up on general guidelines for usage in the [Desktop UI section](/user/ui).

### Sending data

The AutoCAD Civil3D connector supports selection filtering by layer. **The alpha version currently does NOT support sending blocks!**

### Receiving data

Geometry from streams will be added to AutoCAD / Civil3D layers starting with a prefix with the following format:

```
stream[ branch @ commit id ]
```

Any layer information from the incoming stream will be appended to the prefix with the standard AutoCAD delimiter `$`. When recieving from applications (like Rhino) with nested layers, the incoming full layer path will replace any default delimiters with `$`.
