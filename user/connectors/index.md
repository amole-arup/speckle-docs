# Desktop Connectors

The Desktop Connectors are plugins for some of the most popular AEC software including Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, Dynamo, AutoCAD, Civil3D, Unity, Blender and more. They take care of exporting and importing (or better, sending and receiving) data to Speckle Web - without the need of using files!

## Prerequisites

Before you can start sending and receiving data using the Desktop Connectors, you'll need to install the [Speckle Manager](/user/manager). This will allow you to add your Speckle account to your computer and install the different Connectors.
