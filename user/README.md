# Getting Started

## Introduction

Welcome to Speckle - the open source data platform for architecture, engineering, and construction. Speckle liberates your data from proprietary file formats and closed source software and puts it back into your hands. 

We currently have Connectors for some of the most popular AEC software including Grasshopper, Rhino, Dynamo, and Revit with even more in development. Since everything is and always will be open source, you are empowered to extend and adapt it, create your own Connectors, and build your own automations and applications on top of Speckle. You can read more about what we do on [our website](https://speckle.systems/).

## This Guide

In this User Guide, you will get an introduction to the key Speckle concepts and learn how to get set up and send your first objects to Speckle. We'll go over what you need to install, how to create an account, and how to get the Desktop Connectors you need to get going. At the end, there will also be a few [Interoperability Guides](/user/interoperability) which will walk you through all the steps to get your data from AEC Software A to AEC Software B. 

If you are a developer wanting to learn how to build things with Speckle, head over to the [Dev Docs](/dev/). If you want mode in-depth reading on how Speckle works under the hood, make sure to check out our [Deep Dives](/deep-dives/).
