# Introduction

The Desktop Connectors are plugins for some of the most popular AEC software including Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, Dynamo, AutoCAD, Civil3D, Unity, Blender and more. They take care of exporting and importing (or better, sending and receiving) data to Speckle Web - without the need of using files!

Want to see a connector for an application we don't support yet? [Let us know in the forum!](https://speckle.community)

## Installation

All our connectors (with a few exceptions) are distributed via [Speckle Manager](/user/manager). 
Head over to that section to see how to install them and how to add an account!
