# Desktop Connectors

Before you can start sending and receiving data using the Desktop Connectors, you'll need to install the [Speckle Manager](/user/manager). This will allow you to add your Speckle account to your computer and install the different Connectors.

## Grasshopper


## Dynamo


## Revit & Rhino

Revit and Rhino share the same UI, so this section will apply to both applications. If you have specific questions about either one, head over to the [forum](https://discourse.speckle.works/) to get help from the community!

### A Quick Tour

The home page of the Desktop UI is where you can see all the streams you have in your currently open file. The streams are represented as cards on the home page and can be either _Senders_ or _Receivers_. At the bottom right of the window is a big blue "+" button which is how you add new streams to your current file.

Next, let's see how you would add a new stream and send some data to Speckle!

### Sending Data


### Receiving Data

Speckle allows you to send and receive from the same stream. To switch your Sender to a Receiver, just click the double arrow button on the top right hand corner of the stream card.
